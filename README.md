# Diagnosis of eddy transport tensor in a zonal channel model with a ridge

**The finalized notebooks are in final_analysis**. 
The other folders contain notebooks that were used during the exploratory phased.

In this project we test how well the eddy diffusivity tensor model, 

$$
\overline{u'c'} = - \textbf{K} \nabla \overline C,
$$

where $\textbf{K}$ is a tensor, performs at capturing the relationship between the eddy fluxes and their mean gradients. 
We define the mean and eddies both in Z-average and TW-average frames, and compare the similarities and differences.
